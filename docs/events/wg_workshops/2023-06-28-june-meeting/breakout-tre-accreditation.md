# Topic: TRE accreditation

**Session 2, Room 1**

## Prompts

- Who has experience gaining accreditation for a TRE?

## Notes

- Accreditation is awarded at the organisation level
- Existing standards (ISO27001, cyber essentials) are not specific for TREs, they're required by almost everyone
  - Closest is https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/approvedresearcherscheme but even that's not widely accepted
- Have people joined this session to look for guidance?
  - Turing have NHS DSPT, looking at others, and working through SATRE to develop something like an accreditation for TREs
  - UCl is building a new TRE and are interested in which accreditations to target (and which exist)
- Is there any scenario where accreditation could be awarded to a TRE deployment software that is independent of the TRE operator/ institution?
  - Maybe, sounds like a long-shot, would need serious discussion with the data providers
  - Would still require operator/institution to be accredited, but process should be easier by using accredited software
- Why do some orgs favour certain standards?
  - Example: ONS DEA is very useful for people to build on top of but larger orgs have their own staff to develop and adopt standards
  - Needs regulation
- As a data provider, what should I look for in a TRE and their accreditation?
  - Look at assurances and what other data providers have used the TRE
- RSE Community could have high level discussions with orgs like HDR UK / DARE on what TRE regulation could look like?
  - What could we achieve?
    - If ONS can't convince NHS to accept their data standard then needs to go even higher, e.g. brokered by DARE/HDR-UK?
  - How much time to people have?
    - Some people already spend a lot of time on these issues anyway
- UK Data Service (?) is not a crown body, TRE not accepted by some Government bodies
  - UK Government has internal security standards, based on internal government services. Currently impossible for external bodies to be compliant.
- UK quite advanced in building TREs and accreditation, but US has strong accreditation for clinical trials data
