# Topic: Federation standards

**Session 2, Room 2**

- Chair: Rob Baxter

## Prompts

- What levels of standardisation do we need before we've got enough to be trustworthy?
- What can we standardise?
  - Can we think in terms of levels (a la [DARE UK federation architecture](https://dareuk.org.uk/our-work/federated-architecture-blueprint/))
- Managed vs unmanaged ("ptp") federation: DARE UK argues for the first; is it possible to achieve trust through the second?

## Notes

- Is about connecting services together. Connect TREs, data providers, users.
  - It stops before we go too much into architecture
- Without standardisation of those services, connecting them is not that valuable
  - How do we enforce a standard to the existing TRE landscape? Which would make it?
- Every month we are getting a new thing that says it is a federated standard
